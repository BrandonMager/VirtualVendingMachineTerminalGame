# Virtual Vending Machine Terminal Game Script
A Virtual Vending Machine Terminal Game that acts as a simulator to teach people how to run a Vending Machine Business
## How It Works
### Beginning
The program starts by asking the user for a name. Character Validation is included so numbers can't be included
Then the program asks the user how many days (occurences) they want the game to last. With 1 one day, the user can only buy from the supermarket within the game and sell to people on the same day. The more days, the greater chances there are to learning
### Shopping
The day starts off with the user being able to buy items from the supermarket. There are aisles which can be accessed by inputting the Aisle's Number. Within the aisles, there will be a menu of items which the user can select from. Simply, the user can choose to buy that item by inputting the item code. Then the program will give the opportunity to select how many of the item stock they want. The user decides if they want to buy it or change their mind. The user can also access other aisle's by continuing to shop after a purchase. If the user no longer wants to continue shopping, then they begin the item restock on the vending machine
### Stocking
After shopping, the user gets the chance to price the items that were bought.
Once the prices are set, the vending machine is ready.
A random amount of people actually buy the item and a few don't
If there is more than one day, the Shopping and Stocking Phase repeats.
### Ending
Once all of the days are finished, the game will end with the result being a loss if your revenue is less than the amount spent or a win if your revenue is greater than the amount spent
